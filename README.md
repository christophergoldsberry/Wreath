Wreath
======

Arduino code to power a set of LEDs, twinkling them randomly, and playing 'Jingle Bells' on a piezobutton when a button is pushed.

This code is meant to run on an arduino uno board and utilizes code written by D. Cuartielles for K3
and clay.shirky@nyu.edu, to whom I am eternally grateful, as well as examples from the Introduction to Arduino and Advanced Arduino courses written by Roland at Houston's hackerspace - TxRx Labs. Check them out at txrxlabs.org.
Merry Christmas!
