Wreath

Arduino code to power a set of LEDs, twinkling them randomly, and playing 'Jingle Bells' on a piezobutton when a button is pushed.

This code is meant to run on an arduino uno board and utilizes code written by D. Cuartielles for K3
and clay.shirky@nyu.edu to whom I am eternally grateful.

Merry Christmas!
